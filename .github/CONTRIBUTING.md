# Contributing to linkedart.js

We know this library does not include every use-case, or a simple helper for accessing every Linked.Art property. Weâ€™d love feedback or pull-requests to continue to broaden and deepen the library to better support the community.

## Pull Requests

When contributing, please add or update relevant unit tests. To run the Jest tests, first run `npm install`, and then `npm run test:unit`.

## Coding Guidelines

We use a standard linter with our code to make sure that it's consistently formatted. To lint using Prettier:

```bash
npm run lint
```
